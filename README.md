## How to run the project

- Get an api key from [https://newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) by registering for a free account.
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory and copy the contents of the `.env.example` file into it. Change the `REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY` so that it matches the one you got above.
- Run `npm install` 
- Once the process is finished, then simply run `npm start` which will open the project in the browser automatically.
